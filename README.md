# felsenstein-pruning

Implementation of the Felsenstein pruning algorithm for the computation of genetic tree likelihoods.
This script takes a list of genetic sequences, a tree in neweck-format, a vector of equilibrium frequencies of the different nucleotides and the parameters of the TN93 sequence evolution model as input and computes the overall log-likelihood of the tree as the output.

This programming task was given as a biweekly assignment in the class "Computational Biology" by Tanja Stadler, Carsten Magnus and Tim Vaughan at ETH Zurich. The structure of the code, including some predefined helper functions, was given, the implementation of the algortihm is my own.
